Upgrading
---------

  If you're upgrading you will have to re-import your music due to changes in the database.
  Use the mport_gogglesmm12_stats.py script in /usr/share/gogglesmm/utils to transfer playcount statistics.
  Playlists may be preserved by exporting them to m3u files before upgrading.

Last-FM
-------

  Join the Goggles Music Manager group:
    http://www.last.fm/group/Goggles+Music+Manager

  To start scrobble tracks:

    Go to <edit><preferences> and fill in your lastfm username and password.
    If Goggles Music Manager can successfully authenticate with the lastfm service tracks,
    will automatically get 'scrobbled'. If no internet connection is present (or a invalid
    user/password has been given), tracks to be submitted will be queued until a internet
    connection can be established again.

    The queue is kept in ~/.goggles/scrobbler.cache.

  To stop scrobble tracks:

    Uncheck last.fm or remove the lastfm username and password from preferences dialog.
    Note that tracks won't be queued either.

  Limitations / Implementation Details

    * Uses audioscrobbler realtime submission protocol v1.2
    * No proxy support.
    * Standard 1 minute delay before submitting played tracks.
    * 80% of track need to be played to be counted as played.
      Only tracks longer than 30sec will be submitted to last-fm.
